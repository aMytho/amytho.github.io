## Elixir Resources

Elixir is a new programming language. This means that there are less resources to learn it compared to other languages. Below lists some resources that may be helpful.

### Elixir School

Elixir School is a website built by the elixir community. It has articles on all the major features of the language. It also has tutorials for communtiy libraries such as Ecto. This website is helpful if you have a programming background.

### Elixir-Lang (Official)

Elixir-lang is the official website of Elixir. It has some documentation. However, its primary prupose is to go over the fundamentals. As a result, it only goes over built in libraries.

### HexDocs

Hexdocs is not a website. It is a standard for Elixir documentation. It is universally adopted by all Elixir developers. All libraries and frameworks use this format. This makes it easy to move around documentation because the structure is the same for every project.
