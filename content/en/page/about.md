## Tech Stack

This website was built with the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) framework. It is a tool to build static sites. Hugo takes in markdown documents and converts them to HTML. It supports templates, dynamic layouts, site search, and more all with an extremly fast compile time! I used the [Blist](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/blist-hugo-theme/) theme. Github Actions were used to deploy the project when a commit is made.

The source code can be found on the [Github Repo](https://github.com/amytho/amytho.github.io
