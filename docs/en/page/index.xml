      <description>Tech Stack This website was built with the Hugoframework. It is a tool to build static sites. Hugo takes in markdown documents and converts them to HTML. It supports templates, dynamic layouts, site search, and more all with an extremly fast compile time! I used the Blisttheme.
Some changes were made to the CSS to change the site appearance. The homepage was replaced with custom content.
